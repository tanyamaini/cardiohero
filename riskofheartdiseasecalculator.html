        <h4>High Risk (10-13)</h4>
            <p>
               Based on your age, BMI, and lifestyle, you are at high risk of heart disease.<br/> 
               This is not a professional diagnosis, but you may want to monitor your diet, <br/>
               fitness, and sleep to improve your cardiac health. <br/>
            </p>
        <h4>Moderate Risk (6-9)</h4>
            <p>
                Based on your age, BMI, and lifestyle, you are at a moderate risk of heart <br/>
                disease. This is not a professional diagnosis, but you may want to monitor <br/> 
                your diet, fitness, and sleep to improve your cardiac health. <br/>
            </p>
        <h4>At Risk (2-5)</h4>
            <p>
                You are considered healthy compared to the population and are not likely to <br/>
                have low cardiac health, but you are still at an average risk. This is not <br/>
                a professional diagnosis, but although you arenâ€™t at high risk, you should <br/>
                still monitor your diet, fitness, and sleep to improve your cardiac health. <br/>
            </p>
        <h4>Low Risk (0-1)</h4>
            <p>
                Based on your age, BMI, and lifestyle, you are at a low risk of heart disease. <br/>
                This is not a professional diagnosis, but although you are at low risk, you <br/>
                should still monitor your diet, fitness, and sleep to improve your cardiac health. <br/>
